# Club Policy

## Our Goal

Our goal is to learn to read research papers. We're all AI/ML enthusiasts, who would like to become researchers one day!

## Who can join?

This discussion club is for beginners in research. Hence, you don't need any experience in reading papers. That said, 
it's highly recommended to have maths/CS background! I hope that later we will update this repository with lists of recommended courses/books and topics one must know. 

## How do I join? 
- Please add yourself here: [Members List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w5gMKcwRyFKW_3JVB6kEZ6uVT_fHtrrDHxCy5kU0MV8/edit#gid=0). Note: If you're not a part of Secure and Private AI scholarship challenge, you can simply skip Slack column
- Add a link to your github page, so that we can add you to this github organisation  
- Accept invitation to this github organisation 
- Watch the updates: 
    - on Slack (with **papers_dclub** keyword)! :)
    - on Github (more consistent and they don't disappear!)

## How does it work? 
(draft) 

**Do**
1. Phase 1:
  - Step 1. We select a paper from our pool of proposals, using SurveyMonkey
  - Step 2. We estimate a deadline when all the member can complete the reading (SurveyMonkey)
  - Step 3. We read the paper 
  - Step 4. Optional. We make (guess, that's a work for me ~Ana) and take a quiz :) 
2. Phase 2:
  - Step 1: Optional. We write a summary of the paper 
  - Step 2: We discuss the hard parts 
  - Step 3: We decide if we want to implement it (SurveyMonkey)
3. Phase 3 (optional)
  - Implement 

**While NOT(researcher)**

## The rules 

0. This code is written by club members and any member has the right to change the police provided he makes a note on this update and explaines the reason in the commit
1. All members can add/update/delete information (we all assume sanity of all member and trust each other :blush:)
2. All the discussions will be happening in **#general** channel on Slack with keyword **papers_dclub**, so that we can find them easily
4. The paper for the reading is selected by anonymous voting via surveymonkey (democracy! :blush:).
5. You can join/leave at any point, but please be consistent!
6. Paper proposals can be added by any member (add directly to [GoogleDoc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w5gMKcwRyFKW_3JVB6kEZ6uVT_fHtrrDHxCy5kU0MV8/edit#gid=1091439268) - Papers Proposals tab)!
7. It's ok if you don't implement - you can still benefit from analysing existing implementations!
8. Any help is appreciated.
