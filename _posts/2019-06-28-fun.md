title: Meta-meta learning with arXiv descent
---

There are just a few days remaining until the soft deadline for the current paper and I think most of you have already completed it. It's not that long after all. So for something completely different I wanted to share with you one of my favourite mock papers - I hope you can appreciate the humor. :) It's from [SIGBOVIK](http://sigbovik.org) (if you don't know what it is, do google). The paper is **[Meta-meta-learning for Neural Architecture Search through arXiv Descent]**(https://www.bayeswatch.com/unofficial/meta-meta-learning.pdf). Do enjoy and let us proceed with arXiv descent... :)
