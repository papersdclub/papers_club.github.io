title: Live discussion this Sunday!

### Update 2
The next paper has been chosen and I'm pretty excitied about it. 35.14% of our respondents selected [GANs](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets.pdf). The second best choice was the paper on GNNs that gathered 16.22% of voices. There were total 37 votes, so I consider the selection phase complete and close the voting. The updates will follow soon!

### Update 1
**Live discussion** for the current paper (on differential privacy) will take place on Sunday on Slack (SPAIC Slack) at 5PM UTC. Don't forget to take the quiz if you haven't done so already. 

-- Cheers, Ana
