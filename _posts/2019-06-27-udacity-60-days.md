title: 60 days challenge
---

Quick update for today. You all (scholars!) know about about the challenge "60 days of Udacity". The activities you perform in our club also count, so if you worked on reading paper, completing the quiz, writing implementaiton or summary, **DO** list it as a activity in your daily report for the challenge. 
**[IMPORTANT]** We are now trying to arrange it with Akshit to make it clear what counts and what doesn't count for that challenge. We think that reading papers the way we did requires a lot of time and effort and should be counted. We will keep you posted. 

-- Cheers, Ana
