---

We have a lot of updates news today! 

**First**, there is channel now on Challenge Course Slack. (those who are not a part of the challenge course, ignore the channel part).

**Second**, detailed answers to the quiz will be published tomorrow! 

**Third**, there is a repo now for our first paper - feel free to add your implementations (or links to your implementations) there. Please read the [implementation guidelines](https://github.com/papersdclub/theclub/blob/master/implementation_guidelines.md) first. And there is already one implementation by @shivu!

**And finally** Tomorrow we will start the new round of voting for the next paper! Time to move on from PCA! Add your proposals to Paper Proposals sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w5gMKcwRyFKW_3JVB6kEZ6uVT_fHtrrDHxCy5kU0MV8/edit#gid=1091439268)
