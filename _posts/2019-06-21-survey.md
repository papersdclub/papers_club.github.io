title: We're planning a live discussion - please vote!

Marce is running a survey to select our next paper. Please take the [SURVEY](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/YRZB6CP). We're also planning live discussion on Sunday that will be lead by one of the members. 

If you're still reading the paper and planning to take the quiz - **don't panic!** I will not close the quiz. The deadline is for self-control to make sure we're pretty much on the same page. But I will like the quiz open, so that newcomers can take it with their own pace. 

-- Cheers, Ana
