## Update 3
If you have completed reading the first paper (or decided not to complete it at all), plese take a survey (it's very important for future activities): https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/RPTKD9L

## Update 2
The quiz is ready and the link to it will be published here and in #general channel tomorrow. The goal of the quiz is to enhance the paper reading experience. It's not a competition. :) The quiz will be tested by two of our members before I publish it (Marce and Dharmendra). Also, for those who will make it to the implementation stage, Dharmendra will create a quiz that covers practical aspectes of PCA. I saw a few questions - they are great!

## Update 1
The deadline for the reading is tomorrow and I hope most of you will have completed it by that time. But if not - it's still okay (it's soft deadline). There are two more activities we can perform in addition to discussion, which are: 
1. Paper summary. It would be good if somone can write a summary.
2. Poll-quiz on surveymonkey that will help us to understand what was the hardest part of the paper. 

PS. Sorry for not updating for a few days. My life has just changed completely. For good. I was too happy. :) 

-- Cheers, Ana
