title: Github Organisation Created!
---

We have created an organisation for the club - [https://github.com/papersdclub](https://github.com/papersdclub)! This will contain implementations as well as organisational notes, reading lists and other
useful things. If you haven't done it already - request to join. Alternatively, send me a message on Slack or add you github in the GoogleDoc with members! More updates will follow in the nearest future! :) 

-- Cheers, Ana
