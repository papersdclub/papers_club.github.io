title: First Paper Selected!
---

We have selected the first paper for reading. And the winner is ["A Tutorial on Principal Component Analysis"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.1100.pdf).
The paper was selected after running a survey. It turned out that most people were interested in introductory papers. And, actually, there were two winners: the current paper and word2vec. The next survey will include the newly proposed papers. 

-- Cheers, Ana
