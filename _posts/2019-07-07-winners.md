Today we're introducing the [**Hall of Fame**](/hall_of_fame.html). This is the page where we'll be publishing the names of the members who were able to score 9 or 10 on the quiz. You can also see the distribution of scores if you're interested. 

We also had a very nice chat today with some of the members during the virtual meetup and developed a few other ideas on the activites we should add to our paper reading process. We'll keep you posted. 

-- Cheers, Ana
