Marce (Slack: Marce) suggested that we use ReviewNB in our implementations. In short: it allows to review changes (diff) in notebooks in a human-readable way (not JSON diffs!), which is quite cool. I have already installed this plugin for our organisation, and Marce will come up with more info/tutorials soon! :)
