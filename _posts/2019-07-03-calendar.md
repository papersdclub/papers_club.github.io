title: Google Calendar for the club

There was a lot of confusion today on Slack regarding current paper, discussions, etc. So I updated our calendar to reflect all the current deadlines. I will be updating it as we add new deadlines. If I don't do so, please ping me. :) Also, note that each event has a link (e.g. to a quiz or to a paper), so you don't have to look for it. Hope you like it. The link -
